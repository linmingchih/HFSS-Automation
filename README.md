# HFSS-Automation
Providing example code for those who have interests in HFSS automation with Python scripts

## Overview
HFSS is the most popular electromagnetic solver for antenna, RF/MW component, high speed interconnects development. HFSS is integrated in ANSYS Electronics DeskTop (AEDT) platform which allows user to manipulate 3D modeling, simulation setup and simulation data processing with Iron Python. This repository prvoides simple example code and explanation for begginers who want to learn how to automate their simulation jobs in HFSS with script.

## How to Use This Repository
Code and HFSS project of example is grouped in folder. README.md in the folder will explain the function of code. Anyone can follow the guide to practice the function.
